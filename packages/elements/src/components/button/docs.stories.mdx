# Button

A button allows us to highlight actions in the product and make them easily perceived and achievable through just one click.

### When to use it

Use buttons when users need to either navigate through a product or perform a specific action.

### Usage guidelines

- **Do** always label a button in a clear and understandable way
- **Do** always think about the priority of the action to be taken when choosing a variant of button
- **Do** position buttons in a predictable and coherent way throughout the product
- **Do** combine different button types if you have more than one button in a specific screen
- **Do** use a loading state to provide feedback for our user when the action revolves around saving or inputting information, especially when it could take some seconds

### Content Guidelines

- **Do** always start the label with an actionable verb accompanied by a noun to provide enough context (example: "Confirm order"). The only exceptions are the following common actions: "Save"; "Cancel"; and "Close"
- **Do** keep the label to a maximum of 3 words
- **Do** not capitalize all words of the label, just the first word or brand/product words (such as Apple Pay, for example)
